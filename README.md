# Autoresponder

This is a GitHub Integration built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically replies to opened GitHub issues with the contents of `.github/ISSUE_REPLY_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Deploying to Heroku

0. [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy) - Click this button and pick an **App Name** that Heroku is happy with. Before you can complete this, you'll need config variables from the next step.
0. In another tab, [create an integration](https://developer.github.com/early-access/integrations/creating-an-integration/) on GitHub, using `https://[yourappname].herokuapp.com/` (replacing `[yourappname]` with the name from step 1) as the **Homepage URL**, **Callback URL**, and **Webhook URL**. The permissions and events that your bot needs access to will depend on what you use it for.
0. After creating your GitHub integration, go back to the Heroku tab and fill in the configuration variables with the values for the GitHub Integration
0. Create a `.probot.yml` file in your repository. See [Configuring](#configuring).
